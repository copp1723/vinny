    password: 'Robsight1',
    baseUrl: 'https://vinsolutions.app.coxautoinc.com/...'
  },
  webhook: {
    baseUrl: 'https://3000-i1kndzaz6ucdnpebftw9p-1897b1ff.manusvm.computer'
  },
  mailgun: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_MAILGUN_API_KEY',
    domain: 'universalsync.ai',
    fromEmail: 'vinny@universalsync.ai'
  },
  notifications: {
    recipients: ['josh.copp@onekeel.ai']
  }
};
```

## 🎯 How to Run

### **Single Command Execution:**
```bash
npm run autonomous
```

### **What Happens:**
1. **🚀 Agent starts** → Sends start notification email
2. **🌐 Logs into VinSolutions** → Uses your credentials
3. **🔐 Handles 2FA** → Waits for email code from webhook
4. **📊 Navigates to reports** → Finds Lead Source ROI
5. **💾 Downloads report** → Saves Excel file locally
6. **📧 Emails report** → Sends to josh.copp@onekeel.ai
7. **✅ Completion notification** → Success/failure summary

## 📧 Email Notifications

### **Start Notification**
- Confirms agent has started
- Shows execution plan
- Estimated completion time

### **Success Notification**
- Report attached as Excel file
- Execution summary and timing
- Professional formatting with gradients

### **Failure Notification**
- Detailed error information
- Debug screenshots attached
- Steps completed before failure

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### **Real-time Logs**
```bash
# Watch the agent in action
npm run autonomous
```

### **Screenshots**
- Captured at every major step
- Saved to `downloads/` directory
- Automatically attached to failure emails

### **Webhook API**
- Monitor 2FA code extraction: `GET /api/codes`
- Check system health: `GET /health`
- View statistics: `GET /api/stats`

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **2FA Code Not Received**
   - Check Mailgun route priority (should be 0)
   - Verify webhook handler is running
   - Ensure VinSolutions sends to vendora@universalsync.ai

2. **Login Failures**
   - Verify credentials are correct
   - Check for VinSolutions UI changes
   - Review screenshots in failure email

3. **Report Not Found**
   - Ensure Lead Source Analysis section is accessible
   - Check user permissions in VinSolutions
   - Verify report name hasn't changed

### **Debug Mode:**
```bash
# Run with detailed logging
DEBUG=* npm run autonomous
```

## 🔄 Scheduling

### **Cron Job (Daily at 9 AM):**
```bash
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/vinny-agent && npm run autonomous
```

### **Systemd Service:**

## 🚀 Scaling to Other Platforms

This agent architecture is designed to be platform-agnostic:

### **Adding New Platforms:**
1. Create new agent class extending base
2. Implement platform-specific login/navigation
3. Configure webhook routes for 2FA
4. Add to scheduler for automated execution

### **Supported Patterns:**
- ✅ Username/password login
- ✅ Email-based 2FA
- ✅ Report download workflows
- ✅ Professional email delivery

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Fix Mailgun Route Priority** → Enable automatic 2FA
2. **Test Complete Workflow** → Verify end-to-end operation
3. **Add More Reports** → Expand to other VinSolutions reports
4. **Scale to Other Platforms** → Use same architecture
5. **Production Deployment** → Set up scheduling and monitoring

## 🎉 Success Criteria

**The agent is successful when:**
- ✅ Logs into VinSolutions autonomously
- ✅ Handles 2FA without human intervention
- ✅ Downloads Lead Source ROI report
- ✅ Emails report with professional formatting
- ✅ Provides detailed execution logs
